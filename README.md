# ITU-Standard-for-IAA
The first international standard for image aesthetics assessment metadata. 首个面向图像美学评估元数据的国际标准.

# Summary
Image aesthetics assessment (IAA) aims to evaluate whether an image conforms to the aesthetic 
preferences of a potential audience. Recommendation ITU-T F.740.4 defines metadata for image 
aesthetics assessment with aesthetic attributes in a mobile terminal computational photography 
system. The metadata is divided into three dimensions according to the key roles: photographer, 
camera and viewer, and provides non-redundant, fundamental and representative aesthetic attributes 
of each dimension. The role-based metadata defined in this Recommendation can be used to guide 
the construction of IAA datasets, and to provide multiple aesthetic attributes evaluation for IAA. 
Moreover, sample collection requirements and qualifications for annotators are recommended to 
guide high quality data construction.
